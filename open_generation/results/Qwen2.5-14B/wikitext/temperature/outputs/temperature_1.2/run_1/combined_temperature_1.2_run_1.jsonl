The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not entirely clear. Some temnospondyls have rhachitomous, semirhachitomous, and sterospondylous vertebrae at different points in the same vertebral column. Other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category. Rachitomi is no longer recognized as a group, but Stereospondyli is still considered valid.

All of the Olmec colossal heads depict mature men with flat noses and fleshy cheeks ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed. The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the Olmec region in modern times. The backs of the heads are often flat, as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall. All examples of Olmec colossal heads wear distinctive headdresses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals. Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head, and some are decorated with feathers. A head from La Venta is decorated with the head of a bird. There are similarities between the headdresses on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific headdresses may represent different dynasties, or perhaps identify specific rulers. Most of the heads wear large earspools inserted into the ear lobes.", "num_tokens": 239}

Churchill is particularly outspoken about New Age exploitations of shamanism and American Indian sacred traditions, and the \" do @-@ it @-@ yourself Indianism \" of certain contemporary authors. John P. LaVelle of the University of New Mexico School of Law published a review of Indians Are Us? in The American Indian Quarterly.

Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870 s, the torpedo could strike enemy ships below the waterline, causing catastrophic damage. This weapon marked a significant shift in naval warfare, as it allowed smaller, less well-armed ships to threaten even the largest battleships. The torpedo also gave birth to a new type of warship, the torpedo boat, which was designed specifically to carry and launch torpedoes. This development led to the construction of torpedo boat destroyers, which were larger ships designed to protect the fleet from torpedo boat attacks. The torpedo remained a vital weapon in naval warfare throughout the 20th century, and its impact can still be seen in modern naval fleets today.

Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s, the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS Inflexible and the Italian Caio Duilio and Enrico Dandolo. The ironclad's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo. In practice, however, the Jeune Ecole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads.", "num_tokens": 241}
