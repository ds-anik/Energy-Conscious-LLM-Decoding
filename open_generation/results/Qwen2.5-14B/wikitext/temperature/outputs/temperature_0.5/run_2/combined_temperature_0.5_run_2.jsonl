The victory at Hill 202 was a crucial step towards achieving the overall objective of the war, which was to repel the communist forces and restore the sovereignty of South Korea.

Keiser, which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrolling. Keiser decided the patrol should cross the river at the Paekchin ferry. The 9th Infantry reserve, E Company, reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company, was to be the attack force. The 1st Platoon, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31. Two heavy weapons companies, D and H, were each to furnish one section of heavy machine guns, one section of 81 @-@ mm. mortars, and one section of 75 @-@ mm. recoilless rifles for supporting fires. A platoon of 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortars was also to give support.", "num_tokens": 245}
