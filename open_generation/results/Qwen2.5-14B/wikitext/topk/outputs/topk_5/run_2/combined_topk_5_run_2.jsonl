No larger than a flight according to the official history of the Royal Australian Air Force, the Seaplane Squadron was responsible for conducting patrols and reconnaissance missions along the Australian coast. Headlam quickly adapted to his new role and soon became one of the squadron's top pilots. However, his time with the unit was cut short when he was transferred to another squadron to support allied operations in the Pacific during World War II. Despite the challenges he faced, Headlam continued to demonstrate his skill and bravery in the air, earning several commendations for his service. After the war, he returned to civilian life and passed away in 1985 at the age of 79. His contributions to the Royal Australian Air Force are still remembered today. The legacy of Headlam's service lives on not only through the records and commendations he received but also through the memories of those who knew him.
