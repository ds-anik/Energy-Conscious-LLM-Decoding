Later, the vertebrae of temnospondyls became simpler, with fewer individual bones, and these forms were classified as Lepospondyli. However, it was later discovered that Lepospondyli were not actually closely related to temnospondyls, and so the classification was revised.

This more comprehensive approach has allowed for a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships among different temnospondyl species.  [\/INST] Indeed, this comprehensive classification system has helped scientists to identify several major temnospondyl groups.
