In contrast, modern tetrapods have evolved a series of middle ear elements, such as the malleus, incus, and stapes, that work together to match the impedance between the air and the inner ear fluid, allowing for more effective sound transmission. This evolutionary adaptation has allowed tetrapods to develop a greater sensitivity to airborne sounds, enabling them to better detect predators, find prey, and communicate with conspecifics. The tympanic membrane, or eardrum, in the middle ear is particularly important as it vibrates in response to sound waves, and these vibrations are then transmitted to the ossicles, which amplify the sound and direct it to the cochlea, where the sound is converted into neural signals and sent to the brain for processing.
