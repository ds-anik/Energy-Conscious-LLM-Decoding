The department also shares this information with the public, allowing drivers to plan their routes and avoid heavily congested areas. Additionally, ADT data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of transportation policies and initiatives, such as new road construction or public transit investments. [INST] Can you provide more details on how MDOT collects ADT data? [\/INST] Sure, MDT employs several methods to collect ADT data. One common method is through the use of traffic counters, which are electronic sensors installed at specific locations along the roadways. These sensors detect each vehicle that passes over them and record the time and direction of travel. Another method is through manual counts, where trained personnel physically count the number of vehicles passing a certain point during a set period."}
{"idx":99,"completion":"s, the torpedo was a decisive development in naval warfare. It could be launched from a ship, submarine, or even aircraft, and had the ability to travel underwater towards a target at a preset depth. This made it extremely difficult for enemy ships to detect and evade. The torpedo's impact on naval battles cannot be overstated, as it introduced a new level of vulnerability for even the largest and most heavily armored warships. Its invention marked a significant shift in naval strategy and tactics, leading to the development of new defensive measures such as torpedo nets and bulkheads. Overall, the self-propelled torpedo played a crucial role in shaping modern naval warfare. [SEP] The torpedo's effectiveness was demonstrated during several conflicts, including the Russo-Japanese War in 1904-1905 and World War I, where it caused significant damage to battleships. As technology advanced, torpedoes became faster, more accurate, and capable of carrying larger warheads, making them an indispensable part of any navy's arsenal. Today, torpedoes continue to play a vital"}
