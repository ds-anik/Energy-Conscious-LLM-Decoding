Despite heavy casualties on both sides, the NK 2nd Division was unable to penetrate the 23rd Infantry's defenses and was eventually forced to retreat. The 23rd Infantry had successfully held their position and prevented the North Korean forces from advancing any further. This victory was a crucial turning point in the battle, as it boosted the morale of the American troops and demonstrated their determination to defend their territory. [SEP] The following day, the 23rd Infantry launched a counterattack against the retreating NK 2nd Division, further weakening their position and morale. With their momentum lost, the North Korean forces were unable to mount another major offensive and were eventually pushed back by the United Nations forces. The battle highlighted the resilience and bravery of the American soldiers and their allies, and marked a significant victory in the larger conflict.

This attack, launched at 02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery, penetrated F Company. It was apparent that unless F Company's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse. When all its officers became casualties, First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson, adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, assumed command of the company. With North Koreans rapidly infiltrating his company's position and gaining its rear, Robinson in the darkness made his way through them 500 yards ( 460 m ) to A Company's position. There he obtained that company's reserve platoon and brought it back to F Company. He accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of maneuvering it into the gap in F Company's lines in darkness and heavy rain.", "num_tokens": 245}
