Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.", "num_tokens": 254}

The torpedo also had a significant impact on naval tactics and ship design, leading to the development of torpedo defense systems and the use of torpedo tubes in submarines. As a result, navies around the world began to prioritize the development and deployment of torpedoes in their fleets, making it a defining weapon of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [GEN] In addition, torpedoes were also used in land warfare during World War II, with the development of landmines and railway torpedoes. The introduction of torpedoes also led to the rise of antisubmarine warfare, as submarines became a major threat to naval operations. Overall, the invention of the self-propelled torpedo revolutionized naval warfare and had a lasting impact on military technology and tactics.

Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870 s, the torpedo could strike enemy ships below the waterline, causing catastrophic damage. This weapon marked a significant shift in naval warfare, as it allowed smaller, less well-armed ships to threaten larger, more powerful ones.

Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s, the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS Inflexible and the Italian Caio Duilio and Enrico Dandolo. The ironclad's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo. In practice, however, the Jeune Ecole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads.", "num_tokens": 243}
