The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only a swirl of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, mostly to the north of the circulation, due to the strong southerly wind shear. By mid @-@ morning, Josephine re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on Josephine by late morning. The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly.", "num_tokens": 264}
