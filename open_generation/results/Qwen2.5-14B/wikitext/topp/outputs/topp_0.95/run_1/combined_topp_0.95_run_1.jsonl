Overall, the evolution of impedance matching in the middle ear of tetrapods is an important example of how natural selection can drive the development of complex sensory systems. [NL] Let's break down the key points of this continuation: 1. **Thick and Dense Stapes in Early Tetrapods**: - Temnospondyls, early tetrapods, had stapes that were thick and dense. This structure would not be efficient at transmitting vibrations", "gold_ref": "The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.", "num_tokens": 251}
