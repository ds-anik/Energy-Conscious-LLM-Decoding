Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.", "num_tokens": 252}

It was capable of traveling underwater and delivering a powerful explosive charge to enemy ships, making it a formidable weapon against battleships. The torpedo's mobility and stealth made it difficult for enemy ships to detect and defend against, leading to a significant shift in naval tactics and strategy. As a result, navies around the world began to invest heavily in torpedo technology and develop new tactics to counter its threat. The invention of the torpedo marked a turning point in naval warfare and had a lasting impact on the development of modern naval weapons systems. That's a great continuation! Could you also add some information about how the torpedo influenced the design of ships in the late 19th and early 20th centuries? Certainly! The emergence of the torpedo influenced the design of ships in significant ways. Battleships and cruisers began to incorporate torpedo protection systems, such as bulges and belt armor, to deflect or absorb the impact of a torpedo hit.

Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s, the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS Inflexible and the Italian Caio Duilio and Enrico Dandolo. The ironclad's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo. In practice, however, the Jeune Ecole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads.", "num_tokens": 240}
