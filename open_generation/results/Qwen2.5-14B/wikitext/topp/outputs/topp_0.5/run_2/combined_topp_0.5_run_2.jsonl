Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound.

The North Acropolis served as the royal necropolis of Tikal, where the funerary monuments of the city's rulers were erected.

The temples and platforms are adorned with intricate carvings and stucco decorations, depicting scenes from Maya mythology and history.
