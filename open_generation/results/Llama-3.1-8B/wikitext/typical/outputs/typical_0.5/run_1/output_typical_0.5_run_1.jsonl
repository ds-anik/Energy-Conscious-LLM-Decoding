The real-time traffic data is available on MDOT’s website and through various other apps such as Google Maps. [\/INST]\n\n[INST]Since MDOT collects and provides real-time traffic data, would it be able to tell you when traffic is at a standstill and cannot move due to heavy snow or a significant accident on the road? How would this real-time traffic data be beneficial in this situation? [\/INST]\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the role of MDOT in tracking traffic volume\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways through sensors installed throughout the state’s transportation network.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the purpose of real-time traffic data\nReal-time traffic"}
