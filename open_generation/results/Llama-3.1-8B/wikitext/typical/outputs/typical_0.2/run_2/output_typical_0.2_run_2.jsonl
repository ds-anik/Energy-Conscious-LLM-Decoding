When an air-entraining burrow reaches a new underground environment with less impedance (for example, in wet or porous materials), air-entraining animals have less work to do to produce air pockets in that new environment, compared to non-air-entraining animals, and this greatly improves their burrowing performance in terms of rate of advance, excavation efficiency, and ventilation.\n\nHere's a suggested continuation:\n\nImpedance matching allows the stapes to effectively transmit vibrations to the inner ear, enabling the animal to detect sounds more efficiently. In the context of burrowing, impedance matching is crucial for the creation of air pockets, which helps to reduce the resistance and make it easier for the animal to dig and excavate. By minimizing the impedance, the air-entraining animal can move through the soil more efficiently, making it easier to reach new underground environments.
