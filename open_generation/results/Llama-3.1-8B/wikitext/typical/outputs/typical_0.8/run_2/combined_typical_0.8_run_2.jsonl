The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by La Venta in about 900 BC, with Tres Zapotes and Laguna de los Cerros possibly sharing the role ; other urban centres were much less significant. The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear. Very fine Olmec art, much clearly made for an elite, survives in several forms, notably Olmec figurines, and larger sculptures such as The Wrestler. The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population. Together with these, of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the \" Olmec @-@ style masks \" in stone, so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an Olmec context. These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads. Two thirds of Olmec monumental sculpture represents the human form, and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of Olmec art.", "num_tokens": 250}

The next day, Koni reached its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 955 mbar (28.2 inHg). The storm was forecast to recurve to the northeast due to an area of high pressure in the northwestern Pacific. However, Koni was initially expected to pass within 50 miles (80 km) of the Japanese island of Okinawa before making landfall. A tropical storm warning was issued for the island on July 18. At 0600 UTC on July 19, Koni made landfall on the southern coast of Okinawa. The storm made a second landfall later that day on the southern coast of Kyushu, Japan. As Koni moved inland, the storm rapidly weakened due to the land interaction and the presence of the high pressure system.

Tracking westward, intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17. Upon moving into the South China Sea, conditions allowed for quicker strengthening, and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ), making it a severe tropical storm. However, atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July 21, weakening the system. The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi, Vietnam the following day. Tracking inland, the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Koni to dissipate over Laos on July 23.", "num_tokens": 250}
