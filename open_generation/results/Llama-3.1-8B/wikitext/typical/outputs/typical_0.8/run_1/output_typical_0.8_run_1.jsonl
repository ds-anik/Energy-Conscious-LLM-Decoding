{"idx":99,"completion":"s, this early prototype of the modern torpedo was propelled by compressed air, or in some cases, a dynamite charge. It could hit a target at a range of about 1,000 yards, and was capable of sinking a large ship with a single hit. Unlike the spar torpedo, which had to be propelled by a human swimmer, the Whitehead torpedo could be launched from a distance. This made it a more practical weapon, and it paved the way for the development of more advanced torpedoes in the 20th century.
