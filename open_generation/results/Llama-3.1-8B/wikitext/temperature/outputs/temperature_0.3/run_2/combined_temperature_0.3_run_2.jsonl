The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not entirely clear. Some temnospondyls have rhachitomous, semirhachitomous, and sterospondylous vertebrae at different points in the same vertebral column.

The FPDA also included the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States. The Australian government also supported the Indonesian government through the provision of aid and assistance in the development of the country's economy and infrastructure. The Australian government also provided diplomatic support to Indonesia in its relations with other countries, particularly in the region. In 1974, Australia and Indonesia signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, which marked a significant improvement in relations between the two countries. The treaty provided for cooperation in various fields, including trade, education, culture and defence. The treaty also established a framework for the resolution of disputes between the two countries. The treaty was seen as a major achievement for the Australian government, which had been seeking to improve relations with Indonesia for many years. The treaty was also seen as a significant development in the region, as it marked a shift in the relationship between Australia and Indonesia from one of rivalry to one of cooperation.

However, these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973, and the two Mirage fighter squadrons in 1988. Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft, support personnel, and an infantry company known as Rifle Company Butterworth have been maintained, as well as occasional deployments of F / A @-@ 18 Hornet fighter aircraft. Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War. Airforce and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region. Since then the Orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway, conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of Malacca and South China Sea.
