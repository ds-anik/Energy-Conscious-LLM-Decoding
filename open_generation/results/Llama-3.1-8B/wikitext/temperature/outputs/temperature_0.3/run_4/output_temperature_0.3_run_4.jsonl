They are often used to monitor traffic patterns and volumes over time. Temporary traffic counters, on the other hand, are used for specific projects or events and are typically removed once the project is completed. These counters can be either inductive loops or video cameras. Inductive loops are embedded in the road surface and use magnetic fields to detect the presence of vehicles. Video cameras, on the other hand, use computer vision algorithms to detect and count vehicles. Both types of counters can provide accurate and reliable data on traffic volume. The data collected from these counters can be used to inform transportation planning and engineering decisions, such as determining the need for road widening or the placement of traffic signals. In addition, the data can be used to monitor traffic congestion and identify areas where traffic management strategies can be implemented to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow. By leveraging the data from traffic counters, MDOT can make informed decisions to improve the safety and efficiency of Michigan's transportation system."}

The Whitehead torpedo was the first of a long line of self-propelled torpedoes that would become a major weapon in naval warfare.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was a hollow tube filled with explosive that was propelled by a charge of gunpowder. It was the first of a long line of self-propelled torpedoes that would become a major weapon in naval warfare. The torpedo was powered by a compressed air system that propelled it through the water, and it was guided by a gyroscope that kept it on course.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was a significant improvement over earlier torpedoes, which were typically dropped from ships and relied on gravity to propel them through the water. The self-propelled torpedo allowed ships to attack enemy vessels from a distance, without having to get close enough to drop a traditional torpedo. This made it a much more effective weapon, and it quickly became a standard feature of naval warfare.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was also a major innovation in terms of its design and"}
