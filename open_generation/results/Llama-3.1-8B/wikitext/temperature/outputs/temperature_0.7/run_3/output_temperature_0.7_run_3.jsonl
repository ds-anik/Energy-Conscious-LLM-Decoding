For example, roads with extremely high traffic volume may require more frequent maintenance, such as repaving or resurfacing. The levels are also used to determine the appropriate speed limit for the road, as well as"}

By the 1890s, the @-@ Whitehead torpedo had become the standard issue for many navies and was widely used in combat. Its use was the major reason for the development by the Royal Navy of @-@ the Dreadnought class of battleships in 1905, which was designed to be fast and maneuverable enough to outrun torpedoes.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo had a range of about 400 yards and a speed of up to 35 knots. It was heavy enough to require a launching rail, and it was steered using a gyroscopic mechanism. The gyroscopic mechanism made it stable and able to follow a straight course, allowing it to hit its target with greater accuracy. The Whitehead torpedo was made of steel and weighed about 300 pounds.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was widely used in combat by many navies during the 1890s to the 1910s. It was the primary weapon for many ships,"}
