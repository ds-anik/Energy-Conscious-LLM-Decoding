It is calculated by dividing the total number of vehicles that travel on the road segment by the number of days in a year. The AADT is an important metric for transportation planners and engineers as it helps them to determine the capacity of a road segment and to plan for future infrastructure needs.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem\nThe problem is asking for the completion of a text that describes the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) and its importance in transportation planning.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key information needed to complete the text\nThe key information needed to complete the text is the definition and calculation of AADT, as well as its importance in transportation planning.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the correct completion of the text\nThe correct completion of the text is: \"The AADT is a measure of the average number"}

The Whitehead torpedo was a major innovation in naval warfare, as it allowed a ship to attack an enemy without exposing itself to return fire. The torpedo was also more accurate and had a longer range than traditional naval guns, making it a valuable addition to a ship's arsenal.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was first used in combat in 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. The French Navy used the torpedo to attack German ships, but it was not very effective due to the limited range and accuracy of the early models. However, the torpedo's potential was quickly recognized, and it became a standard feature of naval warfare in the late 19th century.\n\nThe development of the Whitehead torpedo led to the creation of more advanced torpedoes, such as the Mark 6 and Mark 7 torpedoes used by the US Navy during World War I. These torpedoes were more accurate and had a longer range than the early Whitehead"}
