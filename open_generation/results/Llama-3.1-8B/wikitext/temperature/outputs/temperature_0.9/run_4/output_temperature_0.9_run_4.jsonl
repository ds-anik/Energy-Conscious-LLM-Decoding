One explanation is that the base was reclaimed by the Union forces in the 1864 push through Southwest Missouri as the Confederates fell back, since conditions at Fort Davidson made this feasible. Another theory is that Union authorities carried out a well-disguised evacuation and parleyed with the commander of the Confederate base at Springfield, General John S. Marmaduke. This is disputed, and even if the Union forces did evacuate Fort Davidson surreptitiously, remainders would likely have become prisoners of war of Marmanduke’s group as Confederate scouted and marched past.

Here are some of the key points about michigan mdot traffic volume data:\n\nMDOT has 140 state highways that are approximately 9,660 miles long, and 132 bridges assigned to the Transportation Asset Management System (TAMS).\n\nThe traffic volume levels are collected using inductive loop detectors and piezoelectric sensors located on various sections of Michigan highways.\n\nThese detectors measure the number of vehicles that pass through them and provide data for various analyses, such as traffic volume, turning movements, and traffic speed.\n\nThe data is used for a number of purposes, including:\n\n* Transportation planning\n* Maintenance scheduling\n* Operations management\n\nMDOT uses the collected data for predictive maintenance and operations to improve road safety and efficiency.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the importance of traffic volume data\nThe traffic volume data is crucial for Michigans MDOT to make informed decisions about road maintenance, management, and safety.\n\n## Step 2: Collection methods used by MDOT\nThe data is collected using inductive loop detectors and piezoelectric sensors"}
{"idx":99,"completion":"rms, the Whitehead torpedo rendered the traditional boats destroyable at a considerable distance. The response of the navy was the pontoon. The pontoon was a large flat bottom boat propelled by oars or by sail. They were designed to allow the crew to move en masse into the vessels that the torpedo boat had failed to disable.\nThe navies of the world then entered a new @-@ phase. The new phase was characterized by a race to develop weapons and tactics to respond to the torpedo boats. Across the world, navies constructed weapons to combat torpedo boats and developed tactics to counter their powerful ability to wound a ship without killing it. The navies turned to deployed submarines, rangefinders, and automobiles.\nThese developments created new @-@ problems that were turned into opportunities. Light surface vessels, typically motorboats armed with machine guns, began to appear. The world soon discovered that these vessels were easy to deploy and could carry mounting machine guns in unexpected places. This outflanked the traditional light vessels. New vessels called destroyers were designed to counter the torpedo boats.\nA"}
