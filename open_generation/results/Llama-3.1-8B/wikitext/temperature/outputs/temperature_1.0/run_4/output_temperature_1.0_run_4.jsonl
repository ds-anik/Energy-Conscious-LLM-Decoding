The main outcome of the conference was the eventual collapse of the Lancaster House Agreement. The all-party constitutional conference, which took place under the United Kingdom's chairmanship, ended unresolved. After Smith's refusal to progress, the conference was declared adjourned in early February 1978, which had become an annual event.
