When Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, flew to Salisbury in March 1975 to meet Smith, he was pained by the aggressive origins and the extent of black politics' lack of progress, but since no bilateral option existed he reluctantly agreed to meet Rhodesian demands that a constitution still contain the \"token veto\" reserved exclusively only to whites. The main outcome of the conference was the eventual collapse of the Lancaster House Agreement. The all-party constitutional conference, which took place under the United Kingdom's chairmanship, ended unresolved. After Smith's refusal to progress, the conference was declared adjourned in early February 1978, which had become an annual event.

No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration. Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA. Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia ( where ZAPU was based ), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho. Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks. According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and \" seemed on the verge of success \" by the start of September 1978. On 2 September, Smith and Nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place.", "num_tokens": 252}

It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period, with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures. After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform, which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ), gradually hiding it from view. Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD, each of them had an elaborate roofcomb and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods.
