{"idx":98,"completion":"measured in terms of Average Daily Traffic (ADT). The ADT is a measure of the average number of vehicles that travel on a stretch of road over a 24-hour period. It is a widely used metric in transportation engineering to assess the traffic volume and intensity on roadways.\n\nThe MDOT uses the ADT to:\n\n1.  **Plan and design roadways**: By understanding the traffic volume, MDOT can plan and design roadways that can accommodate the expected traffic flow, ensuring safety and efficiency.\n2.  **Monitor traffic patterns**: ADT helps MDOT to monitor traffic patterns and identify areas where traffic congestion is likely to occur, enabling the department to take proactive measures to mitigate these issues.\n3.  **Prioritize maintenance and repairs**: By knowing the traffic volume, MDOT can prioritize maintenance and repairs on roadways, focusing on areas with the highest traffic volume and intensity.\n4.  **Evaluate the effectiveness of traffic management strategies**: ADT data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of traffic management strategies, such as traffic signals, tolls, and road closures,"}

The tube was propelled through the water by the explosive force of the gunpowder when the fuse was ignited. The Whitehead torpedo was deployed by the British Royal Navy in 1877, and it was used in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878. The first successful attack using a Whitehead torpedo was made by the British against the Russian frigate Peresvet in 1878. The attack was successful, but the Russian ship was able to return fire and sink the British ship that launched the torpedo. The Whitehead torpedo was used in several other conflicts, including the Spanish-American War of 1898, and it played a significant role in the development of modern naval warfare.\n\nHere is the completed text continuation:\n\nA more practical and influential weapon was the self-propelled or Whitehead torpedo.
