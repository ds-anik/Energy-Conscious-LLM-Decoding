{"idx":99,"completion":"s, it was a hollow tube filled with explosive that could be fired from a ship's deck. The first successful use of this weapon occurred during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba in 1898 when American ships sank several Spanish vessels using these torpedoes.\nThe development of submarines also began to take place around this time. The first submarine was invented by David Bushnell in 1775, but early models were not very effective. It wasn't until the late 19th century that submarines became more practical for military use. The first modern submarine was built by John Philip Holland in 1881. This vessel was powered by an electric motor and had a crew of six. By the end of World War I, submarines had become a major force in naval warfare.\nIn addition to the development of new weapons, there were significant advances in naval technology during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the most important innovations was the introduction of steel-hulled ships. Prior to this, warships were made of wood, which limited their size and strength. Steel allowed for"}
