AADT is the average number of vehicles that travel a specific section of road over a 24-hour period, calculated over a year. This metric is used to determine the traffic volume on a particular road segment, which in turn helps in planning and maintenance of the road network.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem\nThe problem is asking for the completion of a text that describes the Michigan Department of Transportation's (MDOT) method of tracking traffic volume on its roadways.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key information provided in the text\nThe text mentions that MDOT tracks traffic volume using Average Daily Traffic (ADT) and Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) metrics.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the purpose of AADT\nAADT is used to determine the traffic volume on a particular road segment, which helps in planning and maintenance of the road network.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize the need for a conclusion or a final statement\nThe text"}
{"idx":99,"completion":"s, it was the first weapon to use a warhead and a propellant charge to propel a projectile through the water. The Whitehead torpedo was a hollow tube filled with gunpowder and a warhead, which was detonated by a fuse when it struck a target. The propellant charge was ignited by a percussion cap, which was set off by a trigger. The torpedo was steered by a gyroscope, which kept it on course.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was a significant improvement over earlier weapons, such as the harpoon gun, which relied on a harpoon to pierce the hull of a ship. The harpoon gun was prone to jamming and was not very effective in combat. In contrast, the Whitehead torpedo was a reliable and effective weapon that could be used to attack enemy ships from a distance.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was used in several naval battles, including the Battle of Lissa in 1866 and the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. It played a significant role in the development of modern naval warfare and paved the way for the development of"}
