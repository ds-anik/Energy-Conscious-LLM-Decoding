At Fastlane, Lesnar dominated most of the match before he was put through two announce tables by Ambrose and Reigns ; he would ultimately lose the match after Reigns pinned Ambrose. Because of this, Lesnar attacked Ambrose in the parking lot as he was arriving at the arena for Raw, but Ambrose would return later in the night, having hijacked an ambulance, and he challenged Lesnar to a No Holds Barred Street Fight match at WrestleMania 32, where Lesnar defeated Ambrose. On the July 7 edition of SmackDown, it was announced that Lesnar would be facing the returning Randy Orton at SummerSlam.
