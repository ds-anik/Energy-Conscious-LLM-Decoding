The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by La Venta in about 900 BC, with Tres Zapotes and Laguna de los Cerros possibly sharing the role ; other urban centres were much less significant. The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear. Very fine Olmec art, much clearly made for an elite, survives in several forms, notably Olmec figurines, and larger sculptures such as The Wrestler. The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population. Together with these, of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the \" Olmec @-@ style masks \" in stone, so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an Olmec context. These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads. Two thirds of Olmec monumental sculpture represents the human form, and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of Olmec art.", "num_tokens": 251}

The depression rapidly strengthened into Tropical Storm Yanyan, attaining Category 3 strength on January 19. During its period of strengthening, Yanyan attained its peak intensity of 165 mph (270 km/h) at 19:00 on January 20, and 938 mbar (27.3 inHg) at 21:30 UTC on the same day. Yanyan then began to rapidly weaken due to its growing distance from the heat source of the 28\u00b0C (82\u00b0F) waters, and it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 12:00 on January 21, losing most of its tropical characteristics.

Nonetheless, the JMA classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Islands at 0600 UTC on January 15.

At the time, the depression was tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north. Over the next day the system waned in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating. At 0000 UTC on January 17, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity, though the storm remained nameless as the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical depression.", "num_tokens": 251}
