{"idx":81,"completion":"Added whole text:\nThe ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick ectothermic skin, while modern tetrapods like frogs and toads have thin, dry skin. Although the tympanum of temnospondyls is much larger than that of modern frogs, it is not capable of detecting vibrations. This may be due to the impedance mismatch in the air-solid interface. The increased size of the tympanum increases the distance between the tympanum and the stapes, which impairs the transfer of sound energy. The impedance mismatch between the tympanum and stapes occurs because of the change in air pressure caused by the tympanic membrane. This change in air pressure causes a pressure gradient in the fluid of the inner ear. This pressure gradient interferes with the effective transmission of sound vibrations from the tympanum to the stapes.

A developing MESOSCALE STUDY showed that the strong burst of convection would begin to congeal around the center with flanking towers that extended southward toward the center. Waterspouts occurred from this developing spiral.\n\nThe system began to lose its original symmetric shape of about 180 miles across as increasing effects from the wind shear, and brought in dry air with lower humidity and temperatures with an upper level dry slot of dry air stretching northwest to southeast.[INST] The dry air caused a similar symmetrical changing associated with another closed eyewall nearly fully enclosed in a different oval shape than its original symmetrical one and the sheared winds added shear on both sides of the clear eye. In another area outside this storm system, a different area of increased thunderstorm development was foreseen near the circulation center which was,strangely, 5 km north as faster than on the inside of the new developing eye.\n\nA VIS satellite image of the system right after a burst of enhanced convection showed that a"}
{"idx":98,"completion":"measured using traffic volume charts which are generated on a regular basis.\nA link to the current traffic volume chart can be found at [ ^ here]. This chart indicates that overall traffic volume is currently at a level of about 85 percent of the 20-year average. (Note: the website gives an annual estimate based on 20 years of data, not a 20-year average – i.e. the data is normalized to have a 20-year average value of 100.)\nA number of statistics are shown on the chart. Some are relevant to the current traffic conditions, while others represent longer-term averages.\nWe can break down the current statistics into several sub groups:\nWhich statistics describe current conditions, and which are associated with long term averages?\n## Step 1: Identify the statistics provided in the chart\nThe chart provides various statistics that can be categorized into current conditions and long-term averages.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the statistics for relevance to current conditions\nStatistics that describe the current traffic volume, density, and speed are likely relevant to current conditions.\n\n## Step 3: Analy"}
{"idx":99,"completion":"Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s in several navies, it was the first guided projectile. In 1880, it was superseded by the even more modern Whitehead 33 ton which had a range of 2,000 meters and was capable of sinking larger warships. During the late 19th century, many other nations adopted the torpedo as an offensive weapon. By the early 20th century, torpedoes became nearly as common as shells in naval arsenals. They were used in many battles, such as during World War I and World War II. The torpedo was employed by both sides in naval warfare, but the emphasis remained on the use of guns and artillery until World War I. The significant developments of the Whitehead torpedo made the naval war in World War I and the naval battles in World War II much more technologically sophisticated than earlier wars. it than earlier wars.\n \n On the other hand, the steam engine was the major propulsion innovation of the 19th century. The first steam-powered warship was the SS Great"}
