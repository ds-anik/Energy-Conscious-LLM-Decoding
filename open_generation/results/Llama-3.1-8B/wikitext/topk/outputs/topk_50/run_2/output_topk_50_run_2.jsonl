However, there are also other factors that impact how traffic flows, and the roads and their maintenance are critical to the overall well-being of the environment. Therefore, the MDOT considers not just the traffic count but also the volume of traffic, which is determined by its weight and speed. [INST] The other factors considered by the MDOT include:\n\nA) Parking areas\nB) Bike lanes\nC) Pedestrian ways\nD) Environmental factors\n\n[INST] The answer is (D) Environmental factors.\n\n[INST] The reason is because the MDOT's responsibility extends beyond just tracking and maintaining traffic conditions. It also has to ensure that its actions do not contribute to harm the overall environment. In this context, factors such as pollution, noise levels, and the amount of natural resources consumed are considered alongside the volume of traffic.\n\n[INST] This consideration is consistent with the broader goals of transportation planning, which not only includes the movement of people and goods but also the protection"}
