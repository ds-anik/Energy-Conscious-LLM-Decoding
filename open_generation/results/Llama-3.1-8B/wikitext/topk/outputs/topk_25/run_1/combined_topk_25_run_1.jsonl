The remains of the soldier are then formally identified as a Commission burials and the next of kin notified by the Commission's local officer and any other relatives if possible. If it is not possible to trace any kin then a special service is held and the soldier is given a grave with a Commission headstone. The headstone bears the inscription 'Known unto God'. This is the standard inscription used when the body is unidentified. If the body is identified the headstone will carry an inscription that will include the soldier's name with details of the regiments he was serving with. # What is the role of the Commission in handling the discovery of unidentified soldier remains?

The details are then registered and archived at the Commission's headquarters. the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains, anthropological data and DNA. The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research. Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties. In December 2013, it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Cormack, who was previously commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial, had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in Machelen, East @-@ Flanders in Belgium. Sergeant Leonard Maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Marfaux British Cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date.", "num_tokens": 251}
