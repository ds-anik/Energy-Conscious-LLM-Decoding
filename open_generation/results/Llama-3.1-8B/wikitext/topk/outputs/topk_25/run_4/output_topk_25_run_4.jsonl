This was 5 millibars lower than on the 6th, when a previous low had been suspected nearby but had never produced a closed center.  Josephine's center also quickly became more organized, with a central dense overcast (CDO) forming after the low had developed.\n\nBy dawn on the 10th, Josephine was a fully formed tropical cyclone, having completed a circulation loop in the eastern Caribbean Sea. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a [Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert], which indicates a tropical cyclone may be imminent and is expected to form within 12 to 24 hours, although a [Tropical Storm Watch] was still not issued at this time. The NHC estimated that Josephine would reach tropical storm strength within the next 24 hours, but noted that"}

{"idx":99,"completion":"s, a weapon that could travel underwater and strike a ship with its explosive warhead was a significant threat. It was the first military weapon to rely on steam power rather than gunpowder or compressed air for propulsion. However, its first deployment in the Red Sea during the Abyssinian War saw some limited successes and some spectacular failures. It took years of research and development for the engineers to perfect the steam-powered propulsion system and reduce its instability and uncontrolled runs.\n\nThe early torpedoes were powered by steam boilers, which were often unreliable and tended to over- @pressure the water chamber leading to the loss of control over the torpedo's direction. One of the most critical developments occurred with the introduction of the battery or electric torpedo. Launched from a tube or rail, the electric propulsion system offered much greater accuracy, greater consistency, and a much reduced chance of accidents caused by the over-pressure in the water chamber. The use of electric propulsion allowed the torpedo to maintain its course and hit its target much more effectively.\n\nElectric torpedoes made their first use during the Russo-Japanese @"}
