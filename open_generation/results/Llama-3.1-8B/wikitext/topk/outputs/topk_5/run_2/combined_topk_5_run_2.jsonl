Gordon was a seasoned military leader who had previously served with the British Army and later in the Ottoman forces. His mission was to defend the Sudanese city of Khartoum against the rebel forces led by Muhammad Ahmad. However, General Gordon faced a series of challenges that hindered his success. One major issue was the lack of resources and equipment for the British forces. Additionally, the Sudanese rebels, also known as the Mahdist forces, were highly skilled and well-armed, making them a formidable opponent. On January 26, 1885, the British forces, under General Gordon's command, were besieged by the Mahdist forces at the city of Khartoum.", "gold_ref": "During the early years of the 1880s, an Egyptian regime in the Sudan, backed by the British, came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad ( or Ahmed ), known as Mahdi to his followers. In 1883, as part of the Mahdist War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co @-@ ordinate the evacuation, but he was killed in January 1885. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent's expenses. The New South Wales Contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers, and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885.", "num_tokens": 251}
