The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not entirely clear. Some temnospondyls have rhachitomous, semirhachitomous, and sterospondylous vertebrae at different points in the same vertebral column. Other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category. Rachitomi is no longer recognized as a group, but Stereospondyli is still considered valid.

You could now extend the text to continue on from the following point: \"Do not tell them\"; how many examples of this sentence can you give in movies and books? Okay, don\u2019t just provide a common answers like films like *The Shawshank Redemption* or TV shows like *The Sopranos*, instead try to be more creative! Example Answer: The infamous 1969 film *Easy Rider* contains multiple instances where the protagonists are commanded to \"not tell\" them. For example, another character tells the pair \"Don\u2019t tell anyone we gave you the gun\" and later in the", "gold_ref": "When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains. The details are then registered and archived at the Commission's headquarters. the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains, anthropological data and DNA. The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research. Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties. In December 2013, it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Cormack, who was previously commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial, had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in Machelen, East @-@ Flanders in Belgium. Sergeant Leonard Maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Marfaux British Cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date.", "num_tokens": 249}
