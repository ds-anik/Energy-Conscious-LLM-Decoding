This process is part of MDOT’s routine maintenance activities to ensure that roads remain safe for motorists.\nThe traffic levels are measured using sensors, as well as video cameras, that are part of the Michigan Traffic Monitoring Program ( MTMP ). The information recorded through this program is used to assess the condition of roads statewide, identify any problems that may arise, and take steps to repair or rebuild these roads. Moreover, the collected data helps the MDOT to evaluate the efficiency of its repair and construction efforts, which enables the department to continuously improve its services and make necessary adjustments.\nThe information gained from the traffic monitoring program and counting data contributes to various departments of the state of Michigan, supporting policy decisions and planning at various levels of the state government. The data provides valuable insights for urban planners and developers, who use them to determine the adequacy of current infrastructure for population growth or development projects.\nThe data also serves as an indicator of traffic congestion and helps"}

Its development made possible the launching of torpedoes from submarines, which provided a new dimension in naval warfare. Torpedoes were eventually produced in the thousands, first for the British and French navies. By the 1890s, they became more widespread, and their use became more accepted and organized. Because of the power of the explosives used to propel them, torpedoes required a high degree of mechanization in the manufacturing process.[\/INST]\n\nI will fill in the blanks using the information I already have.\n\nA more practical and influential weapon was the self-propelled or Whitehead torpedo.
