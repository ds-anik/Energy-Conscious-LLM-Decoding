The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear. Very fine Olmec art, much clearly made for an elite, survives in several forms, notably Olmec figurines, and larger sculptures such as The Wrestler. The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population. Together with these, of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the \" Olmec @-@ style masks \" in stone, so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an Olmec context. These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads. Two thirds of Olmec monumental sculpture represents the human form, and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of Olmec art.", "num_tokens": 236}

How did the typhoon Koni impact", "full_text": "Koni originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines on July 15. Tracking westward, intensification was slow at first, but after a mid-tropical cyclone wind shear decreased, the system intensified into a tropical storm by July 17. Continued to strengthen, Koni reached its peak on July 18 as a super typhoon, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The system was in this strength for an hour. On July 19, Koni began to weaken due to the increasing typhoon wind shear, and it continued to decrease in strength until it dissipated on July 24. Koni is pronounced as K-O-nee ( /\u02c8k\u0252ni/ , according to the PAGASA. According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Koni was the 11th tropical cyclone and 6th named storm of the 1964 Pacific typhoon season. Although the center was outside the usual path of the typhoon, Koni produced a low atmospheric pressure and a rough sea in the western part of Taiwan and northern part of the Philippines. [Insertion Point] Let's take it from here. How did the typhoon Koni impact", "gold_ref": "Koni originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines on July 15. Tracking westward, intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17. Upon moving into the South China Sea, conditions allowed for quicker strengthening, and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ), making it a severe tropical storm. However, atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July 21, weakening the system. The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi, Vietnam the following day. Tracking inland, the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Koni to dissipate over Laos on July 23.", "num_tokens": 250}
