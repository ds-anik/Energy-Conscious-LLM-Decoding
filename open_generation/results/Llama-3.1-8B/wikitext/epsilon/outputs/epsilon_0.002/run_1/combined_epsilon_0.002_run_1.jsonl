Very fine Olmec art, much clearly made for an elite, survives in several forms, notably Olmec figurines, and larger sculptures such as The Wrestler. The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population. Together with these, of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the \" Olmec @-@ style masks \" in stone, so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an Olmec context. These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads. Two thirds of Olmec monumental sculpture represents the human form, and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of Olmec art.", "num_tokens": 248}

A memorial service and reception are held, and the family is offered the opportunity to view the burial. The remains of some Commonwealth soldiers are transferred from overseas military cemeteries back to the United Kingdom every year and buried in the National Cemetery of the relevant nation with honors. The National Cemetery may also have memorial services, such as the annual Remembrance Day service, with participation from all the service sections. It was also reported that some of the cemeteries of the National Cemetery have a Memorial Wall for Commonwealth soldiers who were killed during the Second World War. The war graves are not duplicated and in the National Cemetery there", "gold_ref": "When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains. The details are then registered and archived at the Commission's headquarters. the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains, anthropological data and DNA. The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research. Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties. In December 2013, it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Cormack, who was previously commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial, had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in Machelen, East @-@ Flanders in Belgium. Sergeant Leonard Maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Marfaux British Cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date.", "num_tokens": 248}

However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only a swirl of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, mostly to the north of the circulation, due to the strong southerly wind shear. By mid @-@ morning, Josephine re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection.
