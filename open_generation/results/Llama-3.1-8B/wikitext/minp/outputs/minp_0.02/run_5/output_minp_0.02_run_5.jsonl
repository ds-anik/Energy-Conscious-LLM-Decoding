The storm continued to intensify, and by 12:00 UTC on October 22, Josephine became the fourth hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km\/h). ["}
{"idx":98,"completion":"measured using various data collection methods, which can be categorized into direct and indirect measurement methods.\n\n## Step 1: Direct Measurement Methods\nDirect measurement methods involve physical observations and are typically used for short-term data collection. Examples include:\n- Manual traffic counts: This involves personnel counting vehicles at specific locations over a set time period.\n- Radar guns: Law enforcement use radar guns to measure the speed of passing vehicles.\n\n## Step 2: Indirect Measurement Methods\nIndirect measurement methods use various devices that can continuously collect data over longer periods, reducing the need for manual counts. Examples include:\n- Infrared and ultrasonic detectors: These are often used in conjunction with automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) to count and measure speed of vehicles.\n- Cameras and video analysis: Used for a variety of traffic monitoring tasks, including speed measurement and volume count.\n\n## Step 3: Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATRs)\nATRs are typically used to continuously count traffic at a site. ATRs can collect data on vehicle speed, volume, and classification (e.g., passenger cars, trucks,"}
{"idx":99,"completion":"s, it was the first underwater launched explosive projectile. The Whitehead was an expensive weapon, and its effectiveness was limited by its accuracy and range, which were both lower than the harpoon. It was not until the 1880s that the development of new torpedoes made them more practical weapons. These newer models had more powerful engines, longer ranges and better steering systems, making them a significant threat to enemy ships. [\/INST]\n\nThe text continues with: \n\"... In fact, torpedoes played a crucial role in the development of modern naval warfare, and their impact can still be seen today. Torpedoes were first deployed in the 1870s, and they quickly became a standard component of naval arsenals. As naval technology continued to evolve, torpedoes became more sophisticated and effective, with the development of guided missiles and other advanced technologies. Today, torpedoes remain a key part of naval warfare, with many modern navies relying on them as a primary means of attack. \"\n\nWould you like to continue the text or is it accurate?\n\nIf you want"}
