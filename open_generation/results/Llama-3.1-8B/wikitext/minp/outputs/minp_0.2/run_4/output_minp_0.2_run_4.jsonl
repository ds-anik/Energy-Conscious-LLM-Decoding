{"idx":98,"completion":"determined by counting the number of vehicles passing a specific point on the road during a fixed time period. This data is crucial for understanding traffic flow and making informed decisions about road construction, maintenance, and improvement projects. However, this method of tracking traffic volume has several limitations, including the inability to accurately account for the number of vehicles using roads that have no fixed counting points, such as highways or freeways with multiple entrance and exit points. This limitation is a major drawback, as these types of roads are often the most heavily used and have a significant impact on traffic flow. To address this limitation, researchers and engineers have been exploring alternative methods for tracking traffic volume, including the use of sensors and other technologies. These new methods aim to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of traffic flow, which can lead to improved decision-making and better road management practices.\n\nThe main limitations of the current method of tracking traffic volume using fixed counting points are:\n\n1.  Inability to account for roads with multiple entrance and exit points, such as highways or freeways.\n2.  Limited accuracy in counting vehicles on roads"}

It was used in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 and the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, and it became the standard weapon for torpedo boats.\n\nThe first submarine to be used in combat was the Ictineo II, a hand-powered submersible used by the Spanish Navy in 1864. The first modern submarine to be used in combat was the HMS Holland 1, a British submarine that was deployed in 1901. It was powered by an electric motor and was equipped with a single 18-inch torpedo tube.\n\nThe first naval aircraft was the Etrich Taube, a German seaplane that was used by the Imperial German Navy in 1911.
