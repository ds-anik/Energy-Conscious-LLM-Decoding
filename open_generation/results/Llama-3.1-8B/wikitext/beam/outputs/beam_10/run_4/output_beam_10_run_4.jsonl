{"idx":98,"completion":"measured in terms of Average Daily Traffic ( ADT ) and Average Annual Daily Traffic ( AADT ). ADT is the average number of vehicles that pass a given point on a road per day, while AADT is the average number of vehicles that pass a given point on a road per year.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the definitions of ADT and AADT\nADT stands for Average Daily Traffic, which is the average number of vehicles that pass a given point on a road per day. AADT stands for Average Annual Daily Traffic, which is the average number of vehicles that pass a given point on a road per year.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the relationship between ADT and AADT\nSince AADT is the average number of vehicles that pass a given point on a road per year, it can be calculated by multiplying the ADT by 365 (the number of days in a year).\n\n## Step 3: Express the relationship between ADT and AADT mathematically\nAADT = ADT * 365\n\n## Step"}

It was powered by a compressed air cylinder and could travel at a speed of up to 35 knots (65 km\/h). The Whitehead torpedo was used by several navies, including the British, French, and American navies, and played a significant role in the development of modern naval warfare.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was a major innovation in naval warfare, as it allowed ships to attack enemy vessels without exposing themselves to return fire. The torpedo's ability to travel underwater made it difficult for enemy ships to detect and defend against, giving the attacking ship a significant advantage. The Whitehead torpedo was also relatively inexpensive and easy to produce, making it a cost-effective option for navies.\n\nThe use of the Whitehead torpedo had a significant impact on the development of naval warfare. It led to the development of new tactics and strategies, such as the use of torpedo boats and submarines, which were designed to launch torpedoes at enemy ships. The Whitehead torpedo also led to"}
