AADT stands for Average Annual Daily Traffic, which is the average number of vehicles that travel on a particular section of road per year.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the relationship between ADT and AADT\nSince AADT is the average number of vehicles that travel on a particular section of road per year, it can be calculated by multiplying the ADT by 365 (the number of days in a year).\n\n## Step 3: Express the relationship between ADT and AADT mathematically\nAADT = ADT * 365\n\n## Step"}
