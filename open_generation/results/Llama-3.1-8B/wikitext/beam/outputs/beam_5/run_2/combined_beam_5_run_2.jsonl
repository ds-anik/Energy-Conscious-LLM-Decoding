Very fine Olmec art, much clearly made for an elite, survives in several forms, notably Olmec figurines, and larger sculptures such as The Wrestler. The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population. Together with these, of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the \" Olmec @-@ style masks \" in stone, so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an Olmec context.
