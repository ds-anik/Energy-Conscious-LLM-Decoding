The storm continued to intensify, and by 12:00 UTC, it had reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km\/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1002 mbar (29.59 inHg). The storm's circulation was still affected by the strong wind shear, but it had managed to maintain a well-defined center. Josephine's outer rain bands extended over 200 miles (320 km) from the center, and the storm's cloud tops were as cold as -80°C (-112°F). The storm's forward motion was slow, and it was expected to continue moving westward over the next few days. The"}
{"idx":98,"completion":"measured in terms of Average Daily Traffic ( ADT ) and Average Annual Daily Traffic ( AADT ). The AADT is a measure of the average number of vehicles that travel on a particular road segment per day over a year. It is calculated by dividing the total number of vehicles that travel on the road segment by the number of days in a year. The AADT is an important metric for transportation planners and engineers as it helps them to determine the capacity of a road segment and to plan for future infrastructure needs.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem\nThe problem is asking for the completion of a text that describes the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) and its importance in transportation planning.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key information needed to complete the text\nThe key information needed to complete the text is the definition and calculation of AADT, as well as its importance in transportation planning.\n\n## Step 3: Provide the definition of AADT\nAADT is a measure of the average number of vehicles that travel on a particular road segment per day"}

The Whitehead torpedo was a major innovation in naval warfare, as it allowed ships to attack enemy vessels without exposing themselves to return fire. The torpedo was also more accurate and had a longer range than traditional naval guns, making it a game-changer in naval battles.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was first used in combat during the 1870s, and it quickly became a standard feature of naval warfare. It was used by many navies, including the British, French, and American navies, and it played a significant role in several major naval battles, including the Battle of Lissa in 1866 and the Battle of Tsushima in 1905.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was a major innovation in naval warfare, and it had a significant impact on the development of naval tactics and strategies. It allowed ships to attack enemy vessels without exposing themselves to return fire, and it made it possible for ships to attack enemy vessels from a distance, rather than relying"}
