Churchill also argues that the portrayal of Native Americans in popular culture is often used to justify the historical treatment of Native Americans, such as the forced relocation and genocide that occurred during the 19th century.\n\nChurchill's work has been influential in the field of Native American studies, and has been widely cited in academic journals and books.

{"idx":98,"completion":"measured in terms of Average Daily Traffic ( ADT ) and Average Annual Daily Traffic ( AADT ). The AADT is calculated by taking the ADT and multiplying it by 365, which represents the number of days in a year. This calculation provides a more comprehensive understanding of traffic volume, as it accounts for the entire year rather than just a single day.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the definitions of ADT and AADT\nADT stands for Average Daily Traffic, which is the average number of vehicles that pass a given point on a road in a day. AADT stands for Average Annual Daily Traffic, which is the average number of vehicles that pass a given point on a road in a year.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate AADT from ADT\nTo calculate AADT from ADT, we need to multiply the ADT by 365, which represents the number of days in a year.\n\n## Step 3: Provide the formula for AADT\nAADT = ADT * 365\n\n## Step 4: Provide an example to"}
{"idx":99,"completion":"s, it was the first weapon to use a self-contained power source, a compressed air cylinder, to propel a projectile through the water. The Whitehead torpedo was a major innovation in naval warfare, as it allowed ships to attack enemy vessels without exposing themselves to return fire. The torpedo was also more accurate and had a longer range than traditional naval guns, making it a game-changer in naval battles.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was first used in combat during the 1870s, and it quickly became a standard feature of naval warfare. It was used by many navies, including the British, French, and American navies, and it played a significant role in several major naval battles, including the Battle of Lissa in 1866 and the Battle of Tsushima in 1905.\n\nThe Whitehead torpedo was a major innovation in naval warfare, and it had a significant impact on the development of naval tactics and strategies. It allowed ships to attack enemy vessels without exposing themselves to return fire, and it made it possible for ships to attack enemy vessels from a distance, rather than relying"}
