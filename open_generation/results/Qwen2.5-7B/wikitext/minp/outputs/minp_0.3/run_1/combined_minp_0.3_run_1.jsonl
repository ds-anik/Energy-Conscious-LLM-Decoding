This process often involves working with local historians, archaeologists, and other experts to piece together the soldier's story. If the identity of the soldier is unknown, the Commission may attempt to use DNA testing or other forensic methods to identify the remains. Once the identity is established, the Commission will work to return the soldier's remains to their home country for a proper burial. In cases where the identity cannot be determined, the soldier may be buried as an Unknown Soldier in a Commonwealth war cemetery. The Commission also works to ensure that the soldier's story is remembered and honored, often through the creation of memorials and the maintenance of war cemeteries.

The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research. Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties. In December 2013, it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Cormack, who was previously commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial, had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in Machelen, East @-@ Flanders in Belgium. Sergeant Leonard Maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Marfaux British Cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date.", "num_tokens": 249}
