The FPDA was a significant military alliance among Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and later, Singapore. The agreement aimed to provide a framework for mutual defense in case of an external attack on Southeast Asian territories, particularly Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. As part of this arrangement, Australia maintained a military presence in Malaysia to support regional stability and security. This commitment demonstrated Australia's continued interest in regional affairs and its willingness to contribute to collective defense mechanisms in the region. Over time, the FPDA evolved to accommodate the changing geopolitical landscape and the emergence of new security challenges in Southeast Asia. The alliance served as a cornerstone for maintaining peace and security in the area, fostering cooperation and confidence-building measures among member nations. Despite the end of the Cold War and the decline of some of the original members, the FPDA remains an important component of Australia's regional defense strategy, reflecting its enduring commitment to the security of Southeast Asia.

The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research. Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties. In December 2013, it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Cormack, who was previously commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial, had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in Machelen, East @-@ Flanders in Belgium. Sergeant Leonard Maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Marfaux British Cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date.", "num_tokens": 247}
