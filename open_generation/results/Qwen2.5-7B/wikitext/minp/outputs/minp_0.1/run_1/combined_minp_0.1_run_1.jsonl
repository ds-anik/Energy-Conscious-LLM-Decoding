Train 8, the ninth one under construction, is expected to be operational by the end of 2023, bringing the total production capacity to approximately 26. 5 mtpa. This expansion is part of Malaysia's broader strategy to enhance its position as a reliable supplier of LNG to global markets. In addition to Train 8, the company is also exploring the potential for further growth through the proposed development of a tenth LNG train. This initiative, if approved and implemented, would add another 6. 8 mtpa to the site's", "gold_ref": "Malaysia LNG is a Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) manufacturing complex located in Bintulu that currently contains eight LNG trains with a ninth one currently under construction. The complex was built by the Malaysian national oil and gas company, Petronas. The manufacturing complex has a production capacity of 25 @.@ 7 million tonnes per annum. Petronas is also planning to open Floating LNG ( FLNG ) offshore Bintulu, which is used specifically to harvest natural gas from small and isolated gas fields. Transportation of natural gas from the neighouring state of Kimanis, Sabah, to the LNG complex at Bintulu is facilitated by a 512 @-@ kilometre ( 318 mi ) pipeline known as the \" Sabah Sarawak Gas Pipeline \". Currently, 45 % of Malaysian natural gas is found at Central Luconia off the coast of Bintulu.
