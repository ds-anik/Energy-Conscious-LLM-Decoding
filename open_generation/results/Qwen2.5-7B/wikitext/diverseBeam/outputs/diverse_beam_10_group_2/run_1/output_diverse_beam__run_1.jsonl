Over time, the volcano was eroded by wind and water, resulting in the current landscape of the Trout Creek Mountains. The process of crustal thinning and the development of a rift zone are indicative of tectonic activity in the region, suggesting that the area was once part of a larger volcanic system. As the volcano eroded, it left behind distinctive landforms such as cinder cones, lava flows, and buttes, which are now prominent features of the Trout Creek Mountains. These landforms provide valuable insights into the geological history of the area and the processes that shaped the landscape over millions of years. The ongoing tectonic activity in the region continues to influence the landscape, with occasional earthquakes and the potential for future volcanic activity.
