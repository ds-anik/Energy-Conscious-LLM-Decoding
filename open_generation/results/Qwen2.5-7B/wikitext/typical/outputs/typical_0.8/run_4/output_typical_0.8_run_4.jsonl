Later, as our understanding of evolutionary relationships improved, scientists began to reclassify temnospondyls based on their overall morphology, not just their vertebrae. This led to the creation of additional subclasses and orders, such as the subclass Dissorophosa, which includes forms with more simplified vertebrae. As research progressed, scientists also recognized the importance of other anatomical features, such as the structure of the skull, jaws, and limbs, in defining temnospondyl groups. These advancements in classification helped to clarify the evolutionary relationships among temnospondyls and provided a more accurate picture of their diverse anatomies and lifestyles. Additionally, the study of temnospondyls has shed light on the evolution of amphibians and their transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments, as well as the diversity of early tetrapods.
