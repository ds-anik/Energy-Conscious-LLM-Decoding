Over time, erosion and weathering have sculpted the landscape, exposing the underlying basalt and creating a unique topography characterized by smooth, rolling hills and low, flat-topped mesas. This geological history has also contributed to the region's distinct ecological features, supporting a variety of plant and animal species adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of the Great Basin. The Trout Creek Mountains are particularly known for their: 1. **Diverse Flora**: Despite the harsh environment, the area supports a surprising variety of plant life, including sagebrush, juniper, and a variety of wildflowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. These plants have evolved unique adaptations to survive in the arid conditions, such as deep root systems and the ability to photosynthesize in low light and high temperatures. 2. **Faunal Diversity**: The region is home to a range of wildlife", "gold_ref": "The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.", "num_tokens": 254}

John P. LaVelle of the University of New Mexico School of Law published a review of Indians Are Us? in The American Indian Quarterly. Professor LaVelle, an enrolled member of the Santee Sioux Nation, states that Indians Are Us? twists historical facts and is hostile toward Indian tribes. It was in this book that Churchill first made the claim that the United States distributed \" smallpox @-@ infested blankets \" to Indian tribes, a claim which he repeated several times over the next decade. The claim has been criticized as a falsification. Churchill has, however, received support from some scholars.", "num_tokens": 242}

The center was weakening, but this new burst of activity posed a significant threat to nearby islands. As the deep burst of convection intensified, it began to draw in more moisture and heat from the surrounding environment, causing the eye of Josephine to slightly contract and the overall structure of the storm to become more defined. The increased convection also led to the formation of a secondary eyewall, which can be a precursor to further strengthening. However, the shear continued to impact the storm's development, preventing it from achieving maximum intensity.

The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only a swirl of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, mostly to the north of the circulation, due to the strong southerly wind shear. By mid @-@ morning, Josephine re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on Josephine by late morning. The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly.", "num_tokens": 243}

For example, if data shows a consistent increase in traffic volume on a particular section of road, MDOT might decide to widen the road to accommodate more vehicles and improve traffic flow. Similarly, if traffic volume spikes during certain times of the day, MDOT might consider adding traffic signals or adjusting traffic flow patterns to enhance safety and reduce congestion.
