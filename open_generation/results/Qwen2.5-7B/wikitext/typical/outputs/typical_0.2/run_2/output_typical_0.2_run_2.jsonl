Instead, a more comprehensive analysis based on multiple anatomical features, including skull, limb, and gill structures, is being proposed. This new approach aims to provide a more accurate picture of temnospondyl evolutionary history. For instance, a study published in 2018 analyzed a large dataset of temnospondyl fossils, integrating morphological data with molecular information, to create a phylogenetic tree that better reflects their evolutionary relationships. Based on this revised classification, the dissorophid group may not be as monophyletic as previously thought, meaning it might not represent a single, continuous lineage of related species.
