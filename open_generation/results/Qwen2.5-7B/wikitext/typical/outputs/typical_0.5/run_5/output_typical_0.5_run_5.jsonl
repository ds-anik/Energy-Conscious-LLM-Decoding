In contrast, later forms, with simpler vertebrae that consist of fewer, more separate components, were seen as more advanced. However, this classification system has been challenged by recent research, which suggests that the complexity of vertebrae may not be the best indicator of evolutionary progression. Instead, a more comprehensive understanding of temnospondyls' anatomy, including their limb structure, skull, and overall body plan, is necessary to accurately determine their evolutionary relationships and position within the amphibian lineage. As a result, the classification of temnospondyls is now based on a combination of anatomical features, rather than solely on the complexity of their vertebrae. This new approach allows for a more nuanced and accurate representation of the diversity and evolutionary history of these ancient amphibians. For example, some temnospondyls, such as Mastodonsaurus, had robust limb structures and a broad, flat skull, indicating adaptations for a terrestrial lifestyle.
