Later, as more complete fossils were discovered and the understanding of temnospondyl evolution improved, scientists began to recognize that the vertebrae alone were not sufficient to classify these animals accurately. As a result, a new classification system was developed, which took into account a broader range of anatomical features, including skull structure, limb morphology, and skeletal characteristics. This new system led to the reclassification of many temnospondyls into different orders and families, reflecting their true evolutionary relationships. For example, some early forms previously classified as labyrinthodonts were found to be more closely related to modern amphibians and were thus reclassified into the order Temnospondyli.

The book delves into the representation of Native Americans in films, literature, and other media, critiquing the stereotypes and misrepresentations that have persisted over time. Churchill argues that these portrayals often serve to reinforce colonialist and racist ideologies, stripping Native Americans of their agency and reducing them to mere objects of fascination or ridicule. By examining a wide range of examples, including classic films like \"The Last of the Mohicans\" and more contemporary works such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" Churchill highlights the ways in which Native American characters are frequently depicted as either noble savages or dangerous primitives, perpetuating harmful stereotypes that have negative impacts on both Native American communities and broader society. The author also discusses the importance of accurate and respectful representation in media, emphasizing the need for Native American voices to be included in the creation and interpretation of narratives involving their cultures and histories.
