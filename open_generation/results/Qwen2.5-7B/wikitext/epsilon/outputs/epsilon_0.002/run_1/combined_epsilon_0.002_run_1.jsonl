General Schmitt's grave has never been found, but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor, the gate leading from the old village of Krems to the hamlet of Stein. The house in which Captain von Stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle. In 1840, a Spanish lithographer created an image of the battle, which was later expanded by English lithographer John Outhwaite. The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the Danube flotilla ( see Infobox image ) on a moonlit night. In fact, the moon was in its last quarter phase 48 hours later, and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image.", "num_tokens": 229}

The 9th Infantry Regiment, part of the 40th Infantry Division, was selected for this operation due to their recent successful performance during the Battle of Peleliu. This plan was to be executed in coordination with other allied forces and involved a series of complex maneuvers designed to maintain the element of surprise and exploit any weaknesses in the Japanese defenses. The goal was to advance and secure key terrain features while minimizing casualties and ensuring the success of the overall campaign. To achieve this, the task force would need to navigate challenging terrain and anticipate Japanese counterattacks.
