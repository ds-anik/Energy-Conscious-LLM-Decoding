Can you provide more details on the environmental concerns and community opposition that were faced during the construction of the Route 29 freeway? During the construction of the Route 29 freeway, several environmental concerns were raised. These included potential impacts on local wildlife habitats, particularly those of endangered species such as the Delmarva fox squirrel and the loggerhead shrike. The construction could disrupt their natural habitats, leading to a decline in their populations. To mitigate these impacts, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) implemented various measures, such as the creation of wildlife crossings and the preservation of existing habitats. Community opposition was also a significant challenge during", "gold_ref": "Between 1990 and 1995, the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township. A two @-@ lane street, Lamberton Road, connected the two freeway sections. Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton. Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the Morrisville @-@ Trenton Railroad Bridge. The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River. The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel. The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2, 2002. A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002.", "num_tokens": 235}

Over time, these adaptations became more refined, leading to the diverse array of hearing structures seen in modern tetrapods. Please help me complete the text continuation based on the following content. As tetrapods continued to diversify, the auditory systems evolved further to suit different ecological niches. For example, some species developed specialized ear structures for detecting low-frequency sounds, which are more prevalent in water, while others", "gold_ref": "The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.", "num_tokens": 249}

Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD, each of them had an elaborate roofcomb and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods.
