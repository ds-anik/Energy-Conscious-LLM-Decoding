Inspired by Carravaggio's \"The Springer\" and an etching by Lucas Cranach the Elder, the series explores themes of human suffering and the psychological torment of human beings.

The critic for The Observer wrote, \" The recent paintings... horrifying as they are, cannot be ignored.

Many Western nations imposed sanctions and canceled development aid, viewing the Internal Settlement as a proclivity to uphold apartheid-like structures. Diplomatic recognition was largely withheld, and there were increasing calls for new elections with universal suffrage to dismantle the entrenched racial inequalities.

Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia ( where ZAPU was based ), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho. Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks. According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and \" seemed on the verge of success \" by the start of September 1978.

The Trout Creek Mountains were formed as part of the broader Columbia Plate", "gold_ref": "The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.", "num_tokens": 240}

This heraldic evolution demonstrates the ongoing importance of religious sites in the region, even as political and ecclesiastical landscapes shifted. As Anglesey's society became more integrated into the monk-patron relationship strengthened by the Norman conquest, the buildings at Capel Lligwy and other churches likely played a crucial role in these new relationships, acting as centers of local Christian worship and possibly centers of learning and social", "gold_ref": "The oldest parts of Capel Lligwy date from the first half of the 12th century. This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north @-@ west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the Normans to gain control of the island. The reason for its construction, and the saint to whom it was dedicated, are unknown. Geraint Jones, author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey, suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel, or connected to a royal court nearby. Yates and Longley, authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments, note that it was built in the large parish of Penrhos Lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times. Despite this, it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right. The chapel is sometimes referred to as \" Hen Gapel Lligwy \" ( \" hen \" being the Welsh word for \" old \" and \" capel \" meaning \" chapel \" ).", "num_tokens": 248}

Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound.
