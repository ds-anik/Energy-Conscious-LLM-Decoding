Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick tympanic membranes, which are less efficient at transmitting sound vibrations compared to the thinner, more flexible tympanic membranes of modern amphibians. This reduction in efficiency is due to the higher impedance mismatch between the outer and middle ear in early tetrapods, leading to a decrease in the transmission of sound energy from the environment to the inner ear. As a result, these early tetrapods likely had a more limited capacity for sound localization and were probably less attuned to environmental sounds compared to their modern amphibian descendants. However, the development of thinner tympanic membranes provided a better impedance match, improving the transfer of sound energy and thus enhancing their auditory capabilities. ... This improvement in auditory sensitivity and localization would have given early amphibians an adaptive advantage in their respective environments, allowing them to better detect and respond to potential threats or opportunities for finding food. For example, they could have more effectively avoided predators by", "gold_ref": "The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.", "num_tokens": 243}

Brad and Tracy have made a lasting impact through their dedication and hard work. Brad initiated and co-organized the annual Coaches Vs. Cancer event in their local community. This event not only raises funds but also creates a sense of unity around the cause. Since its inception, the event has grown substantially, drawing in more participants and attracting wider media coverage. The Stevens have managed to secure corporate sponsorships and public support, thereby increasing the event's reach and impact. Tracy, on the other hand, has been instrumental in educating the community about cancer awareness. She has created and distributed materials that", "gold_ref": "Brad and Tracy Stevens are involved with the American Cancer Society's Coaches Vs. Cancer. Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy's mother died of the disease in June 2004. The day before Butler's 2010 Final Four appearance, they hosted a fundraiser for the organization. Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the Jukes Foundation for Kids, a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes. Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family ; he notably took a one @-@ game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith, a player on both of Butler's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer ; Smith died less than a week later. At the request of Andrew's widow, Sam, Brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17, 2016.", "num_tokens": 244}
