Later, as our understanding of evolutionary relationships improved, scientists began to recognize that other anatomical features, such as the structure of the skull and limbs, provided more reliable indicators of temnospondyl relationships. As a result, the subclass Labyrinthodontia was split into two new subclasses: Labyrinthinthes and Stereospondyls. The Labyrinthinthes, characterized by their labyrinthine (maze-like) internal ear structures and typically smaller body sizes, represent a more diverse group that includes both terrestrial and aquatic forms. On the other hand, the Stereospondyls possess more robust and simplified vertebrae, and are generally larger in size, often with adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle.
