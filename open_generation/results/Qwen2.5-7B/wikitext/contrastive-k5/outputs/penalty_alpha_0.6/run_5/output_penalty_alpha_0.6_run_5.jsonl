Over time, as temnospondyls evolved, their vertebrae became simpler, leading to the classification of later forms as lepospondyls. Lepospondyls had vertebrae with fewer interlocking parts, making them structurally simpler.\n\nIn the evolutionary timeline of temnospondyls, the transition from labyrinthodonts to lepospondyls represents a significant simplification in vertebral structure. This change is not just a morphological shift but also reflects broader trends in the evolution of these amphibians. As we delve deeper into the fossil record, we can observe that this simplification coincides with other evolutionary adaptations, such as changes in limb structure and locomotion, which may have contributed to their diversification and success in various paleoenvironments.\n\nOne of the key features that distinguishes lepospondyls from their labyrinthodont precursors is the reduction in the number of ossified elements within each vertebra.
