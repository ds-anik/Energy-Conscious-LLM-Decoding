This process often involves cross-referencing with military records, photographs, and other historical documents. If the identity of the soldier is successfully determined, the Commission works to notify the soldier's next of kin or descendants. In cases where the identity cannot be confirmed, the soldier is buried with full honors as an Unknown Soldier. The Commission also maintains a database of known and unidentified soldiers, which is regularly updated with new information and discoveries. This database serves as a valuable resource for researchers, historians, and families seeking information about their ancestors. Additionally, the Commission collaborates with various organizations and governments to ensure the proper handling and preservation of these historical artifacts and remains.

The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research. Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties.

Sergeant Leonard Maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Marfaux British Cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date.", "num_tokens": 249}
