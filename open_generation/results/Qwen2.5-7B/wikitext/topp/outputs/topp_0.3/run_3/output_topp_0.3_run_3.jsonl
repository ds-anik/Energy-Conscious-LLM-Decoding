Later, as more complete fossils were discovered and the understanding of temnospondyl evolution improved, scientists began to recognize that the vertebrae alone were not sufficient to classify these animals accurately. As a result, a new classification system was developed, which took into account a broader range of anatomical features, including skull structure, limb morphology, and skeletal characteristics. This new system led to the reclassification of many temnospondyls into different orders and families, reflecting their true evolutionary relationships. For example, some early forms previously classified as labyrinthodonts were found to be more closely related to modern amphibians and were thus reclassified into the order Dissorophia. The reclassification process also revealed that temnospondyls were a diverse group of animals, with a wide range of body sizes and shapes, and that they played important roles in various ecosystems during their long evolutionary history.
