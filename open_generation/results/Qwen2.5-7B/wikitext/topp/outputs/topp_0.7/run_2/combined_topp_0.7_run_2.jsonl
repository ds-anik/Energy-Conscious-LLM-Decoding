For instance, temnospondyls lived in various aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and their ear structures might have been optimized for detecting sounds in these different environments. The thicker tympanum and stapes in temnospondyls could indicate a greater emphasis on detecting low-frequency sounds, which might be more common in water, while modern tetrapods often have thinner ear structures that are better suited for higher frequency sounds in air. This variation in ear structure across different species highlights the evolutionary adaptations that occur in response to diverse ecological niches and sensory needs. Given this information, how might the thicker tympanum and stapes of temnospondyls affect their ability to detect sounds in their environment? The thicker tympanum and stapes in temnospondyls would likely enhance their ability to detect low-frequency sounds, which are more prevalent in aquatic", "gold_ref": "The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.", "num_tokens": 249}

It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period, with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures. After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform, which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ), gradually hiding it from view. Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD, each of them had an elaborate roofcomb and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods.
