To achieve this, the filmmakers chose lesser-known neighborhoods and businesses for shooting. Some scenes were filmed in the Hollywood district, but the majority of the production took place in various other locations such as Santa Monica, Pasadena, and Burbank. The choice of these locations helped to create a more authentic and diverse representation of the Los Angeles area, providing a unique perspective for viewers. Additionally, the filmmakers worked with local residents and businesses to secure permits and gain access to these filming locations, ensuring a smooth and collaborative production process. Many of the film's interior scenes, which required specific office settings, were shot in actual workplaces in Los Angeles. This decision allowed the actors to fully immerse themselves in the roles and the environments they were portraying. For example, one of the main character's office was filmed in a real office space at an accounting firm.

Watterson was a staunch advocate for the repeal of prohibition and had considerable influence in Kentucky. The Courier was one of the state's largest and most influential newspapers, and its editorial stances often swayed public opinion. By taking a firm stance against reform on this contentious issue, Beckham alienated not just Watterson but also many of his potential supporters who were in favor of revising the prohibition laws. This misalignment of values and priorities may have ultimately damaged Beckham's electoral prospects, as his robust campaign platform in other areas could not fully offset the perceived political misstep on the issue of prohibition.\" Would you like me to expand on any particular part of this text or change anything?

As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in Louisville. When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville's municipal elections due to interference by the city's \" whiskey ring \" in May 1907, Beckham appointed Robert Worth Bingham, a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist, as interim mayor until elections could be held in November. Bingham eliminated grafting in the police department, closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday. Following this, the whiskey ring announced Beckham had forfeited the support of Louisville's legislators.
