The Commission takes several steps to ensure the proper preservation and documentation of artifacts found during the identification process. First, they employ trained conservators who specialize in the preservation of historical items. These conservators use appropriate techniques to clean, stabilize, and store the artifacts to prevent further deterioration. Second, detailed documentation is created for each artifact, including photographs, descriptions,", "full_text": "When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts and conduct a thorough examination to determine the soldier's identity and military background. This process is crucial for honoring the fallen and providing closure to their families. If the identity cannot be confirmed, the soldier is often buried with a simple headstone marked \"Known Only to God.\" In cases where the remains are too badly damaged or incomplete, DNA testing may be used to identify the soldier. The Commission also works to preserve and document the artifacts found, which can provide valuable historical context and aid in the identification process.

The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research. Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties. In December 2013, it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Cormack, who was previously commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial, had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in Machelen, East @-@ Flanders in Belgium. Sergeant Leonard Maidment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Marfaux British Cemetery discovered a headstone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date.", "num_tokens": 248}
