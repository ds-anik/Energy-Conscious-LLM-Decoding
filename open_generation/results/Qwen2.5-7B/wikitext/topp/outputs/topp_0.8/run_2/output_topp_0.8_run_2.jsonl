Later, as our understanding of evolutionary relationships improved, scientists began to reclassify temnospondyls based on their overall morphology and phylogenetic analysis. This reclassification led to the division of temnospondyls into three main groups: Labyrinthoraja, Dissoraja, and Microsauria. Labyrinthoraja includes forms with complex, labyrinthine vertebrae, such as Eogyrinus, while Dissoraja comprises those with simpler vertebrae, like Apateon.
